Epilog Fusion Pro 32 Bugs, Glitches, Errors

This repo was created to maintain a list of most frequent problems which occure(d) since we have our laser model Fusion Pro 32 (since beginning of 2020). There are a lot of things which should be changed and most issues were given to support. A lot of them were not fixed, just ignored or forgotten (or simply misunderstood).
